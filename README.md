# Sandboxels_thermal_edit

Slight modification of Sandboxels with improved heat transfer.

Many materials now have specific heat that determines the amount of energy required to raise their temperature.

The temperature of two adjacent pixels is now calculated based on equilibrium temperature rather than average.

Just download the edited index file and run sandboxels with it as you normally would.
